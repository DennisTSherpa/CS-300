# CS-300
SNHU's CS-300 course that I took on 2024.

The following are some questions and their respective answers that I hope will provide an idea of what I aimed to accomplish:


Que 1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Ans 1-> For Project One, I modified the pseudocode of the three milestones I had completed before. Then, I summarized all three milestones' pseudocode in the document named "Pseudocode and Runtime Analysis," where I analyzed the runtime of each respective milestone's pseudocode. Also, provided a short essay on why I chose to base my ProjectTwo.cpp on a Binary Search Tree. 
For context, the three milestone documents utilized one of three data structuresâ€“vector, hash table, and binary search tree. Each milestone's pseudocode utilizes a data structure to perform three functions on a list: 1. Load file, 2. Print an alphanumeric list of the courses, 3. Print a specific course's information and its prerequisites.


Que 2. How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Ans 2-> I approached the problem cool, calm, and collective, with a mentality that denied to give up. Data structures are important because they are the foundation of all computer programs. An epiphany I had stresses its importance neat and brief: if we cannot store data, we cannot work with data.

Que 3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Ans 3-> I had an algorithm for myself, where I just focused on envisioning a solution, implementing it, and repeating it if unsuccessful. This algorithm I programmed into myself allowed me to hurdle over all blockings.


Que 4. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Ans 4-> My work on this project enlightened me on the grueling work behind every program. It has motivated me even more to see what is in store next in this journey of mine: designing software and developing programs!


Que 5. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Ans 5-> My work on this project indirectly forced me to implement multiple functions/methods to segregate each considerable code block. In the end, this approach maximized my program's maintainability, readability, and adaptability, at least for now.
